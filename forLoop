values = []

for i in range(0, 10):
    values.append(i)
#Using list comprehension
# This this takes the normal for loop
# for i in range(10)
# and the i at the beggining is what gets added into the list
values = [i for i in range(10)]
print(values)
###
### This example shows:
### You're still running from 0,9
### But you're adding one each time
values = [i+1 for i in range(10)]
print(values)
